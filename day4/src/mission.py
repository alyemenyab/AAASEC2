"""
DAY 4 — The mission: protected MCP data + shell computation + trace.

READ FIRST:  ../03-putting-it-together.md
(requires src/secure_mcp.py running in another terminal, and 00 + 02 done)

The ONLY async code in this file is GIVEN below, fully commented —
you do not write any async today. (New to async? The 60-second
explainer at the top of src/check_auth.py covers everything used here.)

Each piece contributes one thing, and none of them can be faked:

    MCP        ->  information   (behind auth: no token, no data)
    shell      ->  computation   (analyze.py is written and run BY the agent)
    LangSmith  ->  visibility    (every step, readable after the fact)

Run:
    terminal 1:  uv run python src/secure_mcp.py
    terminal 2:  uv run python src/mission.py

# never knows that inside it, a network protocol and a bearer token
# do the actual work. Hiding machinery behind a boring interface is
# the same trick as Day 3's build_agent() — one level down.
